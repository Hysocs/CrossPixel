# CrossPixel

CrossPixel is the ultimate tool for gamers who want to enhance their aiming experience. Get the edge you need in your games with a crosshair crafted to your unique style.

## Features

### 🖌️ Create Your Perfect Crosshair
With CrossPixel's intuitive paint window, craft a crosshair that represents your unique style. Draw anything you want, from simple dots to intricate designs, and watch your aiming game reach new heights.

### 💾 Save & Share
Tired of losing that perfect crosshair? Fret not! CrossPixel lets you upload, save, and share your designs with ease. Swap between favorites on the fly to suit various games and situations.

### ⌨️ Position Modifier Keybind
Achieve precise alignment effortlessly with CrossPixel's position modifier keybind. Move your crosshair to the right spot on your screen, ensuring your shots are always on target.

### 🔌 Completely External & Secure
Here's the catch – while other crosshair tools often hook into games or Xbox Game Bar, risking bans, CrossPixel takes a different approach. It stays completely external, offering support for a broader array of games. However, it's important to note that fullscreen exclusive support isn't available in this trade-off. You can enjoy your gaming sessions with peace of mind, knowing your experience will remain uncompromised.

### 🚫 No System Installation Needed
CrossPixel is designed for simplicity. Open the program when you're ready to display & refine your crosshair, and close it once you're done gaming.

### 🎯 Pixel Alignment
CrossPixel ensures your crosshair is perfectly centered, giving you the edge you need in those intense gaming moments.
